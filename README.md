## 📌 Executive Summary

This project analyzes Blinkit’s retail sales and operational data to uncover actionable business insights.  

The goal was to evaluate sales performance, product demand, outlet efficiency, and customer trends using SQL-based analysis. By leveraging structured queries and data exploration techniques, the project identifies key drivers of revenue and operational performance.

The insights generated can support data-driven decision-making for category managers, operations teams, and senior business stakeholders.

## 🏢 Business Problem

Blinkit operates in a highly competitive quick-commerce market where performance optimization is critical.  

Key business questions addressed in this project include:

- Which product categories generate the highest revenue?
- How do outlet types perform comparatively?
- What factors influence sales performance?
- Are there patterns in product visibility and demand?
- How can revenue be improved across underperforming outlets?

Without structured data analysis, business decisions around inventory, pricing, and outlet expansion may rely on assumptions rather than insights.

This project aims to provide clarity using SQL-driven analytics.
